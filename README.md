# AZh_to_LLTT
This repository is for the CMS analysis of AZh -> LLTauTau (emu and di-hadronic tau final states) at 13TeV

The analysis takes as inputs flat Ntuples output from UW's Final State Analysis: https://github.com/uwcms/FinalStateAnalysis/tree/miniAOD_8_0_25

The code is C++ based, running flat Ntuples for each channel (eeem,eeet,eemt,eett,mmem,mmet,mmmt,mmtt).
